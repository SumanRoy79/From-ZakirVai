Java Method - instructions and code 

re-use


create - 

non-runnable - 
public returntype nameofthemethod(parameters){



}

public int go(String x){


return 12;
}

using a method - 

1. creating an object of the class 

car c = new car(); 

c.go
what is non-runnable class 

prototype or design of something

non-runnable class - 

feature : 

action of the class >> what it can do >> methods 
properties of the class >> what it is >> global variable 

if you create any variable inside a function that only exist
inside the function - local variable 

if we create a variable inside a class but not inside any function that is a global variable - 

what caraction class can do
start
getmileage
getcarvin
troubleshoot
breakCar 


what are the properties of the class
carmilleage 
ownername
email
isfourdoors
color



properties
car has milleage
car has ownername
car has email
car has isfourdoors
car has color 

method 
car can start
car can getcarmilleage
car can getcarvin
car can troubleshoot
car can breakcar


traditional > method means bunch of code that can be executed
upon called 

OOP > what class can do 

Object oriented programming >> larger system 

facebook is a class 
all the users are object of the class
can do the same thing
chat
post
postpic
comment 

same properties
username
password
email
address
phonenumber 




your system is not doing any OOP 
functions or methods for traditional 

bunch of lines of instruction - 

static 

local variable
global variable
static
