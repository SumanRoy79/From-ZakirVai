Selenium Class - July 10th 


java programming language - 
class - 
run - main method
can't run - doesnt have main method 
main method - scripts - test scripts - 

class - scritps - test scripts 

1. how to store data - variable int/string/boolean/double
2. if/else condition
3. looping - read data from excel 
4. data structure - efficient - array, list, 
5. functions/methods 
 a. how to create a function
 b. how to use a function that you created
 c. how you can use a function from a programming library 

algorithm - 

programming libary - java 

   1. jar file - java archive file 
whats inside a java library - 

           1. class - non runnable classes 


methods, constructor - 
selenium code structure - 
finding web elements - 
creating framework - what is a framework 

How to use testing library and why? 



what is my problem 

come up with a solution



programming libary vs your own function 

1. library - functions are already created by someone - 
we can not modify the function - we dont have any access to the
function 

creating a library -- 

1. 100 classes - non runnable3 
2. 2000 functions 
3. make zip file and upload it 

free - you dont have to pay
opensource - 

sendkeys();

build path - when you run code - your code will look for all libraries or dependencies 


structure of a test scripts - web based application testing 

login panel - and ask you test it 

1. opening up a browser
2. navigating to an url
3. enter username
4. enter password 
5. click on login button 

expected result - user should logged in 
actual resutl  - user logged in - 

test passes 

automate the testing process - 

write some code - code will do that 

java - selenium - browser interaction 

windows based application - it will not work



web based applcation testing 

3 tiers - 

UI testing - manual and automated - 70 percent 
api/web service - api testing - postman/soap ui - rest assured 
database - database testing 







15 - 20 functions 

requirements - application 

manual test case - 


facebook - class

properties of the facebook class
username
password
email
gender
dob 
city 
numberofuser

action of the facebook class 
post()
like()
report()
share()
static resetaccount()


when a new user of facebook is created 

facebook anik = new facebook(); 

facebook michael = new facebook(); 


global and local variable 
static - not part of any object, just stay in class 

automation testing structure: 

object driven frameowork - page object model to seperate
web elements from test scripts 
data driven framework - sepearting test data from test scripts

1. you can write a script - 
maintainance and usuability - 


public class homepage(){




}

code is  not working - you need to fix the code 
test if failing - you can log a defect 
problem : 

1. you can not run multiple script - you can not create 
a test suite 
2. no pass/fail scenario 
3. to test with multiple sets of data 
4. it does not generate any report 
5. you need to a better way to organize your code 

Testing library - 
TestNG 
Cucumber - 
framework - 

setting up TestNG -
