Manual Tester 


1. topics covered already 

2. what to focus for the interview

manual testing >> 

test case
test plan
test strategy 

use case, user stories, tracibility matrix 

defect tracking process 

agile-scrum 

type of testing >> smoke, regression, UAT, sanity

end to end testing 

SDLC >> 

project >> 

responsibilities >> 

3. how to prepare yourself to do best at the interview 

4. strength and weakness 


1. go over all the questions and answers 


step 1: 
requirments analysis: 
who, which form, analyze, if you dont have reqs can 
you write test case 

step 2: test case 

start, tools, share, reveiw, test plan, update test case why 

step 3: executing test case 

how you execute, manual, automated test case, test suite, 
tracibility matrix, testing covergage, automation testing coverage 
smoke 
regression
sanity
uat 

type of test case ; end to end testing, test data, 

step 4: defect 
recreate, log defect, description of defect, communicate with
developer, close 

team aspects : 
agile-scrum
sprint, meetings, 

communication or beahvioural aspects: 
conflict, manage/developer, challanges , struggles, praised 




tracibility matrix - excel 

req 1:                        test case 101, test case 102 




req 13                        test case 145, 156, 132 




req 100 : 

80 of them << 80 percent 

50 of them >> 50 percent automation testing covergate 

tracibility matrix : 

reqs , user stories, 

test case >> validate, verify
use case >> 

test plan: 

scope 
objectives
test environment
test data
test case
exit / entrance


how do you write automated test scripts? 

new builds with new reqs implemented 

manual testing >> smoke testing 

new test scripts, add it to the regression test suite 

convert manual test case to automation test case
directly from reqs
or any other way 
test case >> manual test case, automation test case

test script>> automation 

sprint 1 _ user stories 

smoke testing and regressoin 

sprint 2 - some development done 

create and execute new test case 

smoke test suite
regression test suite 

test script >> 
convert manual test cases
or writing directly from user stories 

type of testing: 
end of release version 12: 

Total >> 100 reqs , 20 reqs has no test case 

80 reqs >> 250 manual test cases , 80 percent 

30 reqs >> 80 test scripts, 30 percent 

manual test case : 250 test cases 

smoke testing : important and critical functionalities

40 test cases are for smoke : 
50 test cases 
regression testing: 
250 test cases , every day 

sanity : 

new functionalities never test before, re-test 

UAT : acceptacne criterion 
before it goes to release 

user acceptance testing 

before deploying : 








250 test cases 

250 - regression - regular basis 
important and critical - smoke - 50 - do first 
new and re-test - sanity - new development
acceptance criterion - UAT - before deployment 

change in the application >> 

new build >> there are some code changes that developer 
pushed in the repository 
smoke testing
regression testing 


new build >> there is a code update
it does not necessarily mean there is new development 

automation testing: 
test suite : collection of test cases 



1. how your framework looks like 

java-selenium-testng 
java-selenium - cucumber 

testng xml - smoke, regression

test scripts , page object model
object driven , data driven 



2. pass/fail scenario 

assertion



3. report 

100 test annotations >> 

html file general 

4. what do you do after getting defect



5. test suite 





page object model - with select 

regression testing >> 

customer for a e-commerce site 

login>> search for product>> add to cart>> go to checkout>> 
payment done 

10 hours study 

start with the easy thing 

page object model >> 
homepage 

hp 
getdropdwosn


select dd = new select(hp.getdropdown()); 

cucumber : bdd - behaviour driven development 

cucumber -
