Cucumber Testing Framework - 


why we are using testing framwork: 

java and selenium only for web interaction 

1. organization of code 
2. test report 
3. data driven testing 
4. test suite 
5. create pass fail scenario 

TestNG, JUnit - traditional java testing framework, UNIT testing 
framework 

cucumber - behaviour driven framework - BDD 

1. cucumber is for manual and automation tester both

@Test 
funciton 
bunch of code 







manual test case type part - manual test case 
feature file 

automation test case part - code 
step def file - java file 

test runner - test suite - Junit 

gherkin keywords - gherkin language 

test feature - scanario - 

one scenario - 1 test case 
Feature
Scenario: 

5 keywords 
Given - describle the pre-requirment of a test 
When - user action 
And - adding multiple when or then steps 
Then - response of the software application 
But - if we are expecting negative response from the application

login panel 

Given user is on the login page 
When user enters valid user name 
And user enters valid password
And user clicks on the login button
Then user should login to the new page

search functionaltieis 

Given user is on the product search page
When user enters selenium books to search
And clicks on the search button 
Then search result should contain selenium books
And  search result should contain price of the books 



feature: given, when, then these are gherking keyword
step def : given, when, then these will annotations 

glue code - step def 

1. page object model 
2. creating data driven frameowork 

seperating the test data from test script

using a data table 

page has no relation with testing 




3. background and hook 


cucumber - 

Test Runner - 
Test Reports - 


code organization - 
maven, git/github, Jenkins 







cucumber test >> 

1. setting up cucumber environment - jar files and plugins 

2. need to create cucumber feature
.feature



10 features - 55 scenarios - table testing - step def

12 feature - 43 scenario - stepdefOne

test suites - collection of test case 

Test Runner - test suite + creating test report 

Junit test runner 

specifying test - tags 

hooks - want to exectue something before and after any feature file 

before and after an scenario - Background

@Before

@After
