what is computer programming? 

a way to tell computer what to do 

procedures 
9AM - need to check email
930 - respond to customers
11 - meet with customer 

code- program - procedure 

programming language - java, python, C#, ruby 

compiler / interpreter 


machine language - 10101010101010

a procedure is set of instructions - 
5 instructions

1000 instructions 

what problem computer can actually solve? 

give me the route to go to newyork? 

Basic computer programming knowledge is common
for any programming language 

1. how in any specific programming lanauge computer
can store data 

2. conditional statment - 

3. loop - execute the same taks as many times as we want 

4. how computer can store huge amount of data 
array, list, 

5. how we can create re-usuable procedure - methods/funtions 


selenium, testng, cucumber

eclipse - intelligent programming editor 

editor - ms word 
notepad - 

intellingent editore to write editor - 

intellij, sublime, drjava

jdk - java development kit - once it is installed, you dont need to worry about this anymore 

jdk - jre + core java library 

jre - java runtime environment 

core java library 

lesson 1: creating a java project 

capital case - 
small case - 

camel case - firstJavaProject

project
package
class
variables

naming conventions for java
a. no space
b. dont use any number 

lesson 2: src folder is the place where we keep all our own 
code 


lesson 3: structure of Java Program - 

one java program - one java class

all the code we are going to write will be inside the java class

java package is a java folder 

why 
how 


every java class is a .java file 
when you run the class - 
if you run a class - 
compile >> .class
run

what is a java class ? 

java class is the basic unit of any java program

public class nameoftheclass { 



}

java keywords are reserved only for java system 

52

every java statment finishes with a semicolon 

1. scope - {} - class, method, conditional, looping - it works
within a specific scope 
2. statment - ; - a line of instruction finishes with semicolon 

if you want to run a java code - you need main method 

runnable class >> class that comes with main method of java
we can run as java application

non-runnble class>> class that doesn't come with main method
we can not run


1. how in any specific programming lanauge computer
can store data 

what kind of data you want to store? 

number name ssn emailaddress amount of money carplate number

java supports specific data type to store data 

datatype variablename = data ; 

100 

int x = 100; 

datatype - int >> we can store any whole number 100, 200, 299
we can count, add, subtract, multiply, division
String >> it can store any set of character anik, virginia, 234433
123 34 2345, 6543

double >> we can store any decimal - 100.10, 65.43

boolean >> can store only true of false 






datatype variablename = data ; 

345 

int numberone = 345; 
int numberTwo=322; 

what is a variable? 
placeholder >> its basically a memory location of your computer

double y




int x = 123; 

x= 12.32
String name = "Michael";
double y = 14.32; 
boolean flag = true; 
flag = 12;

creating a data works in two steps in programming 

int x = 12; 

declaretion 

int x; 
String name; 
double y; 


initialization 
x=12;
name = "michael";

y=12.12;

one line of code
double y = 12.12; 

datatype variablename = value; one step 

datatype variablename; 
variablename = value; 

2. conditional statment: 
are statment that executed based on if a condition is true or false

jdk version 8 ir 1.8
eclipse 2019-06 

x=12; 
y=13; 

x=y; 

x==y if x is equal to y >> false

x>y if x is greater than y >> false

x<y if x is less than y >> true

conditional statment : 
if any code or lines of codes, executed based on one or multiple 
condition, then we call them conditinal statement 




if(condition) {

code if the condition is true

}


// relationship between boolean value and if condition
// bolean variable can be use as result of conditional operator


task 1: you can declare 4 variables 
int string boolean double 
and print the value of those variables 

task 2: create 3 integer variables, 
add the value in a seperate variable and print them
