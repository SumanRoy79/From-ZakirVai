TestNG - testing library - 

replace the main method of java - 

Test Script - is always a runnable class

main method of java to make a test script
TestNG to make test script 


1. Annotations  - organizing our code 

@BeforeTest
public void setupTest(){

// pre requirement/ pre - condition  of the test 
}

@Test
public void mainTest(){

// main test or the full test 
}

@AfterTest
public void endTest(){

// post requirement of the test 

}


Key point: the sequence of the annotations are pre-defined 





TestNG >> Test Next Generation 
Junit -



300 scripts - 300 classes 

@Test - 700 times >> 700 test cases 

@BeforeTest - pre-condition of all the test 
@BeforeMethod - pre-condition before each test 
@Test - the test/tests or main test 
@AfterMethod - post-condition after each test 
@AfterTest - post-condition of all the tests 



the sequence -
