conditional Statement : 

1. what is datatype, variable and value? 

int, String, double, boolean - 
int >> whole number 
String >> character or set of charecter
double >> decimal number 
boolean >> conditional statment >> true or false 

variable is a place holder >> 

String address; 

int number; 

number = 123; 

String number = "34342";

// declaretion and initialization of variable 

int x; 

x = 123; 

x=234; 


2. what is main method? 

without main method we can not run 

main method is the starting point of the code 


3. what is operator? 

+ - * / 

int x = 12; 
int y = 30; 

int sum = x+y; 
int sub = x-y; 

convert celsius temparature and want you to convert it to
farenhite 

celsius value is 12 >> 

farenhite = ((celsius*9)/5)+32

4. what is conditional statement? 
== 
>
<

if I go to california{something will happen}
else if I will go to oregon {something will happen}

else if I will go to washinton{something will happen}
else I will stay at virginia 

creditscore 

if(creditscore>700{

apr = 1.5;
}

else if(creditscore<700 & creditscore >650{

apr = 2.5;
}


and and or operator 


first one
if I can go to california and I have a job 
then I will go to see yosemite mountain 


second one
if I can go to california or I have a job 
then I will go to see bigsur 


&& >> AND 
|| >> or 
software: 

create a software that will calculate your monthly car payment
if you buy a car from a dealship 
software will be used by the dealership 


solutions: 

basecarPrice 
dealership fee 
downpayment
finance amount 
credit score
based on the credit score you get an apr 
final finance amount based on the apr 
how many months you want to pay for the finance amount 
monthly payment = totalfinanceamount/number of months
100 dollar for something
and tax is 3 percent 

totaltax = 100*(3/100);
=3







1. creating class {}
2. main method {}
3. write all the code inside the main method 

datatype variable value
operator + - 
conditional operation == , > , < , &&, ||
conditional statment 
looping >> for loop and while loop 


starting point , condition , increament or decreament operation 

x=1, x<100, x++

java is a case sensitve - a and A is not same














problem : write a program to calculate the sum of first 
10 natural numbers 


1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 .....+100 +.. + 999

int sum = 0 ; 

for (int x = 1; x<11;x++){

sum=sum+x; 

// sum = 1
//sum = 3
//sum = 6
//sum = 10
//sum = 15


}

conditional
loop 
data structure - arrary, list, linkedlist, 
function/method -
