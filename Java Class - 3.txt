Java Method - 

datatype
conditonal
looping
array
methods / functions 

Java Method - 

programming library - already created by some programmers
the codes are already there
we need to be able to use that code 

selenium, testNG, cucumber 

java project - it is just folder - jre system library / jdk automatically available with the library

1. jre is required to run java code so it can compile the code to
make it understable to the computer 

2. it provides us with the java core library - jdk 

3rd party library - selenium, testNG, cucumber 

java project - folder with jre available 
  java package - store java classes, organize our classes,scripts
codes 
    class - 
        we can run - main method 
        we can not run - that does't have main method 

what is a method ? 
   main method - starting point of code , make a class runnable
   other method - those are not main method 

1. how to create a method? 
2. how to use a method that is created by us? 
3. how to use a method that is created by other programmers
or coming from a programming library? 

main method 

public static void main(String args[]){
}



regular method - a method is a bunch of code that we use 
for a specific purpose 

1. it can create re-usuable code 
2. it can distribute the programming task 

input - method - output 

public - access modifier - from which class you can access another class or method 

return type 
public returntype functionaname(int x){


}


public int getnumber(int x, int y){


}

what will be the inputs and output of the method? 

that depends on what you want the method to do

input can be multiple
but output is always one 


problem 1; Create a method that will take credit score as input
and provide apr as output 

input - int
output - double 







template of the method or functions - 

public String getsomething(){


}

runnable class - main method
non - runnable class - doesn't have main method 

public returntype methodname

2. how to use a method - 

you have to create an object of the class 
and the object can use the method 

object oriented programming >> 

classname objectname = new classname();

class - is a prototype or design about what it can store and do

object - is the implementation of the class

design of car - 

create an object to use the method from any class

when we call a function 

       1. from which class the function is coming - so we can object
of the class and use the function 
      2. what are the parameters and return type of the function 

get()
sendkeys()
findelement()

15-20 functions 

1. how to create a function 

public returntype functionanme(parameters){

write what the function is going to do 
you return the value

}

class name data 
public int addData(String x) {


return integervalue; 
}

main method(){

data d=new data(); 
d.adddata("dfa");


}

how do you know about the functions 

has documentation >> go through the docs 

package - class - functions there


15-20 functions 

3rd party libraries - 

input >> system >> output 

input - the parameters - data 
system - method or function
output - return type 

classname
public returntype functionname(parameters){

write the function

}

in a seperate class in main method : 

classaname objectname = new classname();
